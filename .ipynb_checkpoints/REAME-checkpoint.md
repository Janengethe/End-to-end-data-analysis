### End-To-End Data Analysis

* In this project, I analyze the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers on the RMS Titanic, including their age, gender, ticket class, and whether they survived or not. I use pandas for data manipulation and Plotly for data visualization. Finally, I create a Streamlit app to display my analysis and visualizations.

* The goal is to explore the dataset, identify trends and correlations, and present findings through intuitive visualizations. Through this analysis, I hope to gain insights into the factors that may have contributed to the passengers' survival during the sinking of the Titanic.
